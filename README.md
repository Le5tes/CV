## Tim Williamson

I am a motivated and capable software developer looking for an exciting opportunity to build on my skills. 

I graduated from the University of Cambridge as a qualified veterinary surgeon, but quickly decided that I'd be more interested in pursuing my former hobby in coding as a profession. Since then I first completed tutorials in C++ and then joined Maker's Academy, an intensive software development bootcamp, which I graduated from on 16/2/18.

## Skills and Attributes
I am a:

#### Fast and Motivated Learner
I have an excellent head for facts, but more importantly I'm able to quickly understand new concepts and apply them to problems, often in novel ways, to achieve good results. I also love to learn. I've always found I'm happiest when getting my head around a new system, concept or idea.

#### Excellent Problem Solver
My brain works in a very logical and analytical way that, combined with my attention to detail, makes me very good at solving problems, from fixing bugs to designing systems to complete a complicated task.  

#### Great Communicator
My time as a vet gave me excellent opportunities me to develop my communication skills. In particular I am very adept at communicating complex technical and scientific concepts to lay-people in a way that is easy to understand. 

This was something that was quickly noticed by my fellow students at Maker's Academy; from the first week people started coming to me to explain the things we were learning. Later in the course I put myself forward to mentor a couple of students from the january cohort, something I have enjoyed greatly. 

#### Maker
It's not just software! Growing up, my bedroom was littered with circuitry, little mechanical robots and even off-cuts of wood. My most recent project has been a foamboard remote control plane with a five foot wingspan! Whenever I have a problem I make something to solve it. 

#### Adventurer
Whether it's medicating wildebeest in Africa, designing my first side-scrolling shooter game when I was 18 or putting myself in a ring for three rounds of kickboxing against someone who wants to beat me up, I've never been put off doing something interesting or exciting because it was too difficult, time-consuming or physically uncomfortable.
