# Tim Williamson 

I am a motivated and capable software developer looking for exciting opportunities to build on my skills. 

I graduated from the University of Cambridge as a qualified veterinary surgeon, but quickly decided that I'd be more interested in pursuing my former hobby in coding as a profession. Since then I first completed tutorials in C++ and then joined Maker's Academy, an intensive software development bootcamp, which I graduated from on 16/2/18. Since then I have been working as a professional software engineer for Santander Technology, utilising agile methodogies and best practices to build and deploy high quality web software.

## Skills and Attributes
I am a:

#### Fast and Motivated Learner
I have an excellent head for facts, but more importantly I'm able to quickly understand new concepts and apply them to problems, often in novel ways, to achieve good results. This ability has served me well in school, university and most recently at Makers Academy.

I also love to learn. I've always found I'm happiest when getting my head around a new system, concept or idea.

#### Excellent Problem Solver
My brain works in a very logical and analytical way that, combined with my attention to detail, makes me very good at solving problems, from fixing bugs to designing systems to complete a complicated task.  

#### Great Communicator
My time as a vet gave me excellent opportunities me to develop my communication skills. In particular I am very adept at communicating complex technical and scientific concepts to lay-people in a way that is easy to understand. 

This was something that was quickly noticed by my fellow students at Maker's Academy; from the first week people started coming to me to explain the things we were learning. Later in the course I put myself forward to mentor a couple of students from the january cohort, something I have enjoyed greatly. 

#### Maker
It's not just software! Growing up, my bedroom was littered with circuitry, little mechanical robots and even off-cuts of wood. My most recent project has been a foamboard remote control plane with a five foot wingspan! Whenever I have a problem I make something to solve it. 

#### Adventurer
Whether it's medicating wildebeest in Africa, designing my first side-scrolling shooter game when I was 18 or putting myself in a ring for three rounds of kickboxing against someone who wants to beat me up, I've never been put off doing something interesting or exciting because it was too difficult, time-consuming or physically uncomfortable.
